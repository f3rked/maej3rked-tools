# **_v2.24.0_**

_Release: 12-01-2024_

### Notes

- There was a site update about a week ago that changed the css for the video player to respect the aspect ratio. Previously,
  this stretched the video player to whatever the size of the container was. In the case of bigscreen, this means, now there are bars on
  side or top based on the size of your browser window to keep the aspect ratio at 16:9. So I've added an option to match the previous behavior for
  those that prefer it.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix chat settings not working on the popout chat

### Features Added / Changed

- Add option to have big screen mode match previous behavior to fit the video player to the size of the window
- Reoganize options - added video player options section

---

# **_v2.13.6_**

### Notes

- Fixes the script trying to run everywhere using GreaseMonkey.
- The way webpack is packing and minifying the script adds multi-line comments to the userscript.config.js, which for some reason, GreaseMonkey doesn't like, but TamperMonkey mind. This "fix" doesn't actually address the issue with webpack since there probably won't be any more updates to this -- it just replaces the userscript banner with the proper single-line comment format, so building this yourself for GreaseMonkey will still produce the same issue, unless you remove the multi-line comments manually after building.

# **_v2.13.5_**

### Notes

- This will get things working again and will probably be the last update until S3.

### Notes

- This update is to help prevent inturruptions, primarily for the sake of clippers/streamers.
- It's unknown how the "disable sound effects" option will affect livestream audio once cams are enabled, but it shouldn't be an issue. If it is, I'll try to get an update out quickly.
- Enabling "Toggle Global Mission pop-ups" may reduce performance as it has to watch the entire page body for mutations to hide the goldstriker background image.

# **_v2.4.6_**

### Notes

- The new "MidChat" mode will break to BigChat around 1200px due to how the site handles sizing of the chat window, however, you'll still be in MidChat mode if you resize down below 1200ishpx, so you'll still need to toggle twice to get back to normal mode...this is not a bug! Don't @ me about this.

### Bug Fixes

- N/A

- Settings tab to edit "Friends" and "Watched" users and their corresponding highlight colors. Google HEX or RGBA color generator to find colors.
