### HOW TO: Build from source

## Before contributing

- please install esbenp.prettier-vscode or the javascript code formatter of your choice to keep style more consistent
- do not include changes to the user script file (maej3rked-tools.user.js) or the package.json - I will update those when bumping the version and pushing out the new update

1. Start by cloning the repository into your project directory

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f3rked/maej3rked-tools.git .
   ```

2. install the dev dependencies (listed at the bottom of this readme)

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

**Note**: _Build output will be located at `./dist/maej3rked-tools.user.js`_

---

### HOW TO: Start in Dev Mode

Create a new Userscript using your browser extension of choice (eg: Tampermonkey) and add the following...

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name         MAEJ3RKED-TOOLS [DEV MODE]
// @description  Development Version of MAEJ3RKED-TOOLS
// @version      0.0.0
// @icon         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3rked/maej3rked-tools/master/public/images/icon.png
// @match        *://*.fishtank.live/*
// @run-at       document-idle
// @require      file:\\\PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR\dist\maej3rked-tools.dev.user.js
// ==/UserScript==
```

**Be sure to replace `PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR` with the path to your actual project directory and save the new userscript.**

Then navigate to your project root

eg:

```bash
cd C:\Users\BigHeadedLoser\Desktop\maej3rked-tools
```

And Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now any time you update and save a `.scss` or `.js` file, Webpack will automatically rebuild the plugin. You must refresh Fishtank.live to see your changes.

**Note**: _Build output will be located at `./dist/maej3rked-tools.user.js`_
